I am a 4th-year undergrad from the [School of International Studies](https://www.nottingham.edu.cn/en/humanities-and-social-sciences/schools-and-department/international-studies/home.aspx), [University of Nottingham Ningbo China](https://www.nottingham.edu.cn/en/index.aspx). My research interests include organized crime, deepfake technology in organized crime, human and drug trafficking, substance dependence, corruption, Chinese criminology and queer criminology.

My BA dissertation focused on methamphetamine (meth) trafficking in China. This project will be descriptive research based on open-access sentencing documents. I aim to present a dynamic of meth imports and implement network analysis and descriptive statistics to provide a comprehensive examination of meth trafficking, including the pattern of geographic routes and the demographic characteristics of captured trafficking offenders. This project is supervised by [Dr. Tracey Fallon](https://research.nottingham.edu.cn/en/persons/tracey-fallon)
